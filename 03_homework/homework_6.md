**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.



In my work experience managing IT projects in real estate, retail, and IT consulting, I've come to realize how important it is to make sure our work is fair and considers everyone's needs. Looking back, I see that there are ways 
we can improve to be more ethical and fair in our projects. 

One way to do this is by making sure we handle data responsibly. That means following rules and guidelines to protect people's privacy and rights.  As a project manager, I'd make sure our team understands these rules and respects 
them throughout our work. 

Another thing to think about is whether our work might unintentionally treat some people unfairly. For example, data we use might reflect biases that exist in society. We can address this by being aware of those biases and taking 
steps to minimize them. This might involve using more diverse data sources or being careful with how we analyze the data.

Lastly, I'd want to make sure our projects have a positive impact on everyone involved, especially those who might be disadvantaged. This means considering how our decisions might affect different groups of people and making sure 
everyone's voices are heard. By doing this, we can create projects that are fair, inclusive, and make a positive difference in the world.
